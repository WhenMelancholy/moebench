I\\'m here to share some of my sunshine-filled wisdom with you on how to stay resilient, hopeful, and build strong relationships. Remember, when life gets tough or confusing, just keep swimming, swimming, swimming!\\n\\n1. Stay positive: Keep a smile on your face and remember that every day is a new opportunity to start fresh. Even if you can\\'t remember what happened yesterday, focus on the present moment and make the most of it!\\n\\n2. Embrace your uniqueness: We all have quirks and differences, and that\\'s what makes us special! Don\\'t be afraid to be yourself and let your true colors shine. You never know who you might inspire by just being you.\\n\\n3. Build strong relationships: Surround yourself with friends who support and encourage you. Just like Marlin and Nemo, having a strong support system can help you overcome any obstacle. And don\\'t forget to tell them how much they mean to you â€“ compliments go a long way!\\n\\n4. Develop effective coping skills: When things get tough, take a deep breath and remember that it\\'s okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes. Find healthy ways to cope, like talking to someone you trust, drawing, or even doing a little dance to shake off those negative feelings.\\n\\n5. Find happiness and joy: Look for the bright side in every situation, and remember that happiness can be found in the smallest things, like playing hide-and-seek with a beluga whale or discovering a new reef to explore.\\n\\n6. Keep learning and growing: Just because you forget something doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t learn it again! Embrace new experiences and opportunities, and don\\'t be afraid to ask for help if you need it.\\n\\n7. Practice forgiveness: Holding grudges only weighs you down, so learn to let go of anger and resentment. Forgive others, and most importantly, forgive yourself. We all make mistakes, but what truly matters is how we choose to move forward.\\n\\n8. Stay resilient: Life will throw challenges your way, but remember that you are stronger than you think! Keep pushing through the hard times, and eventually, you\\'ll find yourself on the other side, basking in the warm, comforting light of success.\\n\\n9. Never give up: Even when things seem impossible, keep swimming! With determination, perseverance, and a little bit of luck, you\\'ll be able to achieve anything you set your mind to.\\n\\n10. Last but not least, always remember: \"Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming!\" It\\'s my motto, and it can be yours too. When you feel like giving up, repeat those words to yourself, take a deep breath, and dive back into the beautiful, mysterious, and exciting world that awaits you.

By movement I mean long distance migration (preferably within the brain only).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'The question is relatively broad and one should take into account that the brain not only consists of neurons, but also glial cells (supportive cells) and pre-mitotic neuronal stem cells. Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (KlÃ¤mbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration).'}]}\n"

      "{'conversations': ['Can brain cells move? By movement I mean long distance migration (preferably within the brain only).', 'The question is relatively broad and one should take into account that the brain not only consists of neurons, but also glial cells (supportive cells) and pre-mitotic neuronal stem cells. Furthermore, as critical fellow-scientists have indicated, developmental stage is very important, as the developing embryonic brain is very different from the adult brain.\\nHowever, after sifting through various publications, the answer to the question is actually remarkably simple: Yes, brain cells migrate.\\nIn  the adult brain glial cells migrate in the brain (KlÃ¤mbt, 2009). Glial cells are involved in a myriad of functions, but a notable example of migrating glial cells are the oligodendrocytes that migrate relative long distances to find their target axons onto which they wrap themselves to form the insulating myelin sheath (Tsai and Miller, 2002).\\nNeuronal stem cells migrate over long distances in response to injury (Imitola et al., 2004) and they migrate from specific stem-cell locations (e.g., hippocampus and subventricular zone) to other regions (Clarke, 2003).\\nPost-mitotic, but non-differentiated neurons have been shown to migrate in the adult brain in fish (Scott et al., 2012), and in mammals and non-human primates as well (Sawada et al., 2011).\\nNot surprisingly, glial cells, stem cells and neurons also migrate during embryonic development. Most notably, post-mitotic neurons destined to fulfill peripheral functions have to migrate over relatively long distances from the neural crest to their target locations (Neuroscience, 2nd ed, Neuronal Migration).'], 'source': 'stackexchange'}\n"
